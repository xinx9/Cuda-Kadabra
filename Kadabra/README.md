# KADABRA: an ADaptive Algorithm for Betweenness via Random Approximation

## Synopsis

This repository contains the source code of KADABRA, an adaptive probabilistic algorithm for 
approximating the betweenness centrality of nodes in a network. 
The algorithm is presented in the paper [*KADABRA is an ADaptive Algorithm for
Betweenness via Random Approximation*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08553).


## Installation 

The software requires the [OpenMP API](http://openmp.org/wp/). After cloning this repository,
build the software by issuing the `make` command inside the project folder: 

    $ make
    g++ -fopenmp -std=c++11 -Ofast -Wall -pedantic -g -Iinclude main.cpp src/* -lm -o kadabra

To test the software, see the [code examples below](#usage-and-code-example).

## Usage and Code Example 

The network has to be provided as a file containing two space-separated
integers `u v` per line, for each edge `(u,v)` of the network. The labels of
the vertices are assumed to be consecutive. 

The following examples are based on the networks provided in the `example_input` folder of
the project, taken from the [SNAP dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html).

default).
